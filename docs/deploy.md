# Production deploy (single Azure VM)

How the production stack runs on the single Azure VM (`germanywestcentral`). **Status: built, not yet
deployed.** The infrastructure exists as code across slices; CD (`vars.ENABLE_DEPLOY`) is still off.

- **Slice 1** — VM + network + Key Vault + Managed Identity + GitHub-OIDC deploy role (`infra/vm/terraform/`).
- **Slice 2** — the prod runtime topology: `compose.prod.yaml`, the Caddy single-origin router
  (`infra/vm/caddy/`), and the cloudflared tunnel.
- **Slice 3** — Key Vault → credential files: `argus-secrets.service` fetches secrets via the Managed
  Identity into `/run/argus/secrets/` (tmpfs) — `infra/vm/secrets/`.
- **Slice 4 (this)** — CD: `cd.yml` builds/scans/signs both images → GHCR, then `az vm run-command` rolls out
  (`infra/vm/deploy/deploy.sh`) with **migrate-before-serve**. Gated behind `vars.ENABLE_DEPLOY`.

## Topology

```
users ─HTTPS─▶ Cloudflare edge (TLS · WAF · rate-limit) ─tunnel─▶ cloudflared ─▶ caddy:8080
               caddy serves the PWA + reverse-proxies /api,/ws → api:3000
               api ─▶ postgres / redis (internal Docker network, NO published ports)
               api ─▶ Backblaze B2 (egress, presigned)
```

The VM opens **no inbound port** (NSG denies all inbound; `infra/vm/terraform/`). The only way in is the
**outbound** Cloudflare tunnel. TLS, WAF, and the edge rate-limit live at Cloudflare; Caddy speaks plain HTTP
on a non-privileged port over the internal Docker network only. Threat model:
`docs/threat-models/vm-ingress.md`.

## The stack (`compose.prod.yaml`)

Standalone prod stack — **not** layered over `compose.yaml` (that file is local-dev only). Services:
`postgres`, `redis`, `api`, `caddy` (PWA + router), `cloudflared`. No `minio` (prod uses Backblaze B2). No
service publishes a host port. Every service runs hardened (non-root where the image allows,
`no-new-privileges`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, resource limits).

> Self-hosted **Zitadel** on the VM is roadmap checkpoint 9 (Phase 1). It joins this stack there, behind
> Caddy + Cloudflare Access on an admin subdomain. Until then the prod `api` has no OIDC issuer wired.

### Images

`api` and `caddy` are **pulled by tag**, not built on the VM — `cd.yml` builds, scans (Trivy), and signs
(cosign) them, and sets `ARGUS_API_IMAGE` / `ARGUS_INGRESS_IMAGE` to the registry digest (Slice 4). To build
the ingress image locally for verification:

```bash
docker build -f infra/vm/caddy/Dockerfile -t argus-ingress:local .   # context = repo root
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml config -q                         # validate the stack
```

## Release & rollout (CD — `cd.yml`)

**Release on a version tag.** To cut a release you push a semver tag — the version *is* the image tag, so the
deployed artifact is always traceable to the git tag:

```bash
git tag v1.4.0 && git push origin v1.4.0
```

That triggers `cd.yml`:

1. **Builds both images** (matrix: `api` + the Caddy `ingress` that bakes the PWA), tagged with the version →
   pushes to **GHCR** → **Trivy** scan (fail on HIGH/CRITICAL) → **syft** SBOM → **cosign** keyless sign +
   attest.
2. **Rolls out** — logs in to Azure via OIDC, bundles the exact-SHA infra config (compose + the secret-fetch
   unit + `deploy.sh`) into an `az vm run-command` invocation, so the **VM token stays pull-only** (it can't
   read the repo). The control plane runs `deploy.sh` as root on the VM (no SSH, no open port).

**Two-layer gate.** `vars.ENABLE_DEPLOY` is the master kill-switch (off until the Azure subscription +
secrets exist). The deploy job runs in the **`prod` GitHub Environment** — configure it with **required
reviewers (you)**, so every tagged release **pauses for your manual approval** before the root run-command
runs. The OIDC federated subject is bound to that environment (`var.github_deploy_subject`), not a branch.

`infra/vm/deploy/deploy.sh` on the VM: installs/refreshes `argus-secrets.service` → fetches the runtime
secret set (Managed Identity → `/run/argus/secrets`) → `docker login ghcr.io` (token from Key Vault) + pulls
the images → **`cosign verify`s** each (against this repo's `cd.yml` OIDC identity) and rolls out **by
digest** → brings up Postgres/Redis → runs **DB migrations as the owner** (file-mounted DSN, then `shred`-ed)
**before** the api serves → brings up `api` + `caddy` + `cloudflared`. Idempotent + fail-closed.
Threat model: [`docs/threat-models/vm-cd.md`](threat-models/vm-cd.md).

**Repo vars/secrets** (from the Terraform outputs): secrets `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`/`AZURE_TENANT_ID`/
`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`; vars `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`/`AZURE_VM_NAME`/`KEY_VAULT_NAME`; the api's non-secret
runtime config `S3_ENDPOINT`/`S3_REGION`/`S3_BUCKET`/`S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (the B2 key **id**) +
`OIDC_ISSUER`/`OIDC_AUDIENCE` (CD passes these into `compose up`); the PWA's build-time `VITE_OIDC_*`; and
`ENABLE_DEPLOY=true` to arm it. GHCR **push** uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`; the VM's GHCR **pull** uses
the `argus-ghcr-token` PAT from Key Vault — set `vars.GHCR_USER` to the account that owns that PAT if it isn't
the repo owner (the default).

## Cloudflare tunnel ingress (dashboard-managed)

cloudflared uses a **token** tunnel (the token stored in Key Vault as `argus-tunnel-token`). Ingress
hostnames are configured in the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, not in this repo:

- `4rgus.com` → `http://caddy:8080`  (the app — PWA + `/api` + `/ws`, all same-origin)
- admin subdomains (e.g. ops/identity) → their service, **gated by Cloudflare Access** (identity at the edge)

## Secrets (Key Vault → credential files — Slice 3)

No secret values live in the repo. `argus-secrets.service` fetches them from Azure Key Vault via the VM's
Managed Identity into `/run/argus/secrets/` (tmpfs, `0400` root) at boot — see
[`infra/vm/secrets/`](../infra/vm/secrets/README.md). The stack consumes them as **mounted credential files**
(Docker secrets at `/run/secrets/*`), which the app reads via `*_FILE` env vars (invariant #5 — never the
value in env). Compose's secret sources point at `${ARGUS_SECRETS_DIR}` (`/run/argus/secrets` in prod,
`./secrets` in local dev):

- `secrets/postgres_password` → Postgres reads it via `POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE` (the **owner** account, for
  init + migrations).
- `secrets/database_url` → the api reads it via `DATABASE_URL_FILE`. This DSN **must** use the non-bypass
  runtime role `argus_app` (`postgres://argus_app:<pw>@postgres:5432/argus`), **not** the `argus` owner — so
  RLS and grants still bind on any query path that misses `SET LOCAL ROLE` or under app compromise. Slice 3
  grants `argus_app` LOGIN + a Key Vault password (migration 0001 creates it NOLOGIN); the owner credential
  stays separate, used only for migrations (Slice 4 `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`).
- `secrets/s3_secret_access_key` → the api reads it via `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_FILE` (the B2 key secret).

The **`TUNNEL_TOKEN`** is the one secret that can't be a mounted file — the cloudflared image has no shell and
no `--token-file` flag. Invariant #5 also permits a **runtime-fetched value**, so it's injected from the
deploy environment (`environment: TUNNEL_TOKEN`), never an on-disk env file.

Set the actual values in Key Vault once (the `az keyvault secret set` commands + the full name→file→consumer
table are in [`infra/vm/secrets/README.md`](../infra/vm/secrets/README.md)). Non-secret config (B2
endpoint/region/bucket + access-key-**id**, the API's OIDC issuer/audience, the PWA's build-time
`VITE_OIDC_*`, image tags) is in `.env.prod.example` — copy it into the deploy environment. The `secrets/`
directory (local dev) is gitignored; nothing is committed or baked into an image.
