# Threat model: billing and plan gating

> **RETIRED (Phase 6, 2026-06-17).** Billing/Stripe and plan-gating were removed in the enterprise
> teardown — the invite-only model has no plans or member limits. The billing/plans/webhooks modules and
> the plan/stripe columns' readers are gone. Kept for history; see
> `docs/threat-models/phase-6-decommission.md`.

## 1. Feature & data flow

G8 adds plan tiers (free / pro / enterprise) stored on the `tenants` table, enforced at the NestJS layer. Stripe handles payment; the server never handles raw card data — only Stripe price IDs and customer/subscription IDs (non-secret metadata). Stripe webhooks drive plan assignment after payment.

Data flows:
- **Admin → `POST /billing/checkout`** → server creates a Stripe Customer (if new) and a Checkout Session → returns a Stripe-hosted URL → browser redirects to `stripe.com`. Card data never touches the Argus server.
- **Stripe → `POST /webhooks/stripe`** → signature-verified event → server writes plan columns to `tenants`.
- **Operator → `PATCH /operator/tenants/:id/plan`** → OPERATOR_API_KEY-gated → writes plan columns directly (for manual overrides and pilot customers).
- **All tenant-scoped APIs** → member-limit and SSO-feature gates enforced at the NestJS service layer before any DB write.

## 2. Assets & trust boundaries

Assets:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — authorizes all Stripe API calls; must stay in Key Vault.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — validates webhook authenticity; prevents fake events from upgrading plans.
- `OPERATOR_API_KEY` — grants plan write access to any tenant; high-value secret, Key Vault only.
- Plan tier columns on `tenants` — control access to features (member count, SSO).

Trust boundaries:
- Client ↔ Server: clients supply `successUrl`/`cancelUrl`; server validates they are URLs (Zod `.url()`) but does not follow them.
- Stripe ↔ Server: webhook authenticity is verified with `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent`; tampered or replayed events fail signature check.
- Operator ↔ Server: `OPERATOR_API_KEY` bearer token; read at request time from Key Vault credential file, not cached.

## 3. Threats (STRIDE-lite)

**Spoofing:**
- Fake Stripe webhook: mitigated by `constructEvent` HMAC-SHA256 signature verification using `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. A 400 is returned on any mismatch; the event is never processed.
- Replayed / duplicate events: Stripe delivers at-least-once. The webhook checks the global `stripe_events` table (event id PK; no tenant data, no content) and **records the event id only AFTER its handler succeeds** (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). A redelivery of an already-recorded event is skipped; a crash or throw before recording leaves the event unrecorded, so Stripe's retry re-processes it — an event is never marked done without being done (no silent loss, no DELETE/release path needed). Handlers are additionally idempotent (live-state re-fetch + stale-sub guards + absolute writes), so a re-processed redelivery just repeats harmless work; the common success-replay case is deduped, removing duplicate `tenant.plan_changed` audit rows.
- Operator impersonation: OPERATOR_API_KEY must be a long-lived secret from Key Vault. `timingSafeEqual` from `node:crypto` is used for the comparison, eliminating timing oracle attacks.

**Tampering:**
- Limit bypass via race on member creation: member-limit is checked at BOTH `createInvite` and `acceptInvite`. The second check (inside the `withTenant` transaction) is the true race-safe gate.
- Plan downgrade manipulation: no client input flows to plan writes. All plan changes originate from Stripe-verified webhooks or the operator key.
- Webhook tenant-context (the one **sanctioned exception** to "tenant context only from the verified session", `db/index.ts`): the Stripe webhook is the single place a tenantId reaches `withTenant` from a third-party-relayed value (`metadata.tenantId`) rather than the authenticated request. Safe because (a) the body is Stripe-signature-authenticated, and (b) argus is the **sole writer** of `metadata.tenantId`, set under a verified `auth.tenantId` at checkout creation — Stripe's customer portal cannot edit it. Enforcing controls: `checkout.session.completed` cross-checks the session's `metadata.tenantId` against the Stripe Customer's own metadata, and every webhook-derived tenantId is UUID-validated before opening a `withTenant` transaction; a mismatch or malformed value is logged (metadata only) and skipped — never processed, never 500-looped.

**Information disclosure:**
- Stripe secret key exposure: delivered as a Key Vault credential file (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_FILE`); never in env at rest, never logged.
- Billing metadata in logs: price IDs and Stripe customer IDs are logged at WARN level only; they are non-secret metadata (price IDs are visible in every Checkout URL, customer IDs carry no payment data). No card data, subscription amounts, or personal billing details are logged.
- `GET /billing/status` returns plan tier and member count (metadata only, no billing PII). Gated by AdminGuard.

**Elevation of privilege:**
- Feature unlock without payment: Stripe webhook fires after payment confirmation; `checkout.session.completed` maps price ID to tier — an unknown price ID is logged and ignored (no upgrade). `customer.subscription.deleted` reverts to free.
- SSO config accessible on free plan: `sso.service.ts` checks `plan.ssoEnabled` at the top of `createSsoConfig`; returns 402 before any Zitadel provisioning.

## 4. Invariant check

1. **Crypto-blind server** — billing touches only plan metadata columns and Stripe IDs; no content or keys involved.
2. **No secret logging** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` are never logged. Only price IDs (non-secret) and config-missing warnings are emitted.
3. **RLS** — `tenants` has FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY (`tenants_self_isolation` policy keyed on `app.tenant_id`); all reads and writes run inside `withTenant(tenantId)` which sets this session variable. No cross-tenant reads possible. Stripe `tenantIdFromCustomer` derives the tenant from the Stripe Customer's metadata (argus-written) instead of a DB lookup; the value is UUID-validated before any `withTenant` transaction, and `checkout.session.completed` additionally cross-checks the session metadata against the customer (see §3 Tampering — the sanctioned webhook exception). The `stripe_events` dedup table is intentionally global / no-RLS (operational data, no tenant_id, no content) — like `user_tenant_index`.
4. **No hand-rolled crypto** — Stripe's `constructEvent` uses the official SDK's HMAC; no primitives in application code.
5. **Secrets via Key Vault** — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_FILE`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_FILE`, `OPERATOR_API_KEY_FILE` follow the credential-file pattern.
6. **No admin content access** — billing surfaces expose plan metadata only; no message content, attachments, or keys involved.

## 5. Decision & mitigations

- Signature verification on every webhook; 400 on failure, no partial processing.
- Member limit checked at create-invite (UX gate) AND accept-invite (race-safe hard gate).
- SSO gate at `createSsoConfig` entry before any Zitadel API call.
- Plan mutations are audit-logged (`tenant.plan_changed` with `actorNote` = `'stripe-webhook'`, `'operator'`, or `'billing'`).
- Operator endpoints excluded from customer-facing OpenAPI spec (`@ApiExcludeController`).
- Webhook endpoint excluded from OpenAPI spec (`@ApiExcludeEndpoint`), marked `@Public()` (JWT not applicable; Stripe's signature is the auth).

Reviewer gates: `security-boundary-auditor` (plan enforcement paths, operator endpoint, webhook surface).

## 6. Residual risk

- **Operator key timing-safety**: `timingSafeEqual` (constant-time) is used — no timing oracle risk.
- **Webhook replay window**: Stripe's `constructEvent` rejects events with a timestamp more than 300 seconds old by default. Replays within that window are deduped via the `stripe_events` table (event id recorded only after a handler succeeds, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`) and skipped on redelivery; a failure before recording lets the retry re-process, and `setPlan` writes absolute values idempotently regardless. **Retention**: `stripe_events` rows are tiny and low-volume (a handful per subscription change); a periodic prune is a documented follow-up, not yet built.
- **Concurrent duplicate delivery (accepted residual)**: the dedup records an event id only *after* its handler succeeds, so a crash/throw never marks an unprocessed event done (at-least-once; no silent loss). The trade-off is that two *simultaneous* deliveries of the same event id can both pass the `isProcessed` gate and both dispatch before either records. This is harmless: `setPlan` writes absolute values and `disableSsoForTenant` is idempotent, so the final entitlement is correct — the only artifact is a possible duplicate `tenant.plan_changed` audit row. We deliberately do **not** claim-before-dispatch to close this race, because that reintroduces the strictly worse failure (a crash between the claim and the plan write would permanently dedupe Stripe's retry and lose the change). Fully serializing per event id (a connection-pinned advisory lock, or a lease/heartbeat with reclaim) is deferred as disproportionate to a rare, harmless race for the beta.
- **Stripe outage**: if Stripe is down, checkout/portal fail gracefully; the plan stays as-is. No plan data is lost.
